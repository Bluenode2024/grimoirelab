# Governance in GrimoireLab

The following norms describe how GrimoireLab is managed.

GrimoireLab is part of the [CHAOSS Collaborative Project](http://chaoss.community)
and any participation in their projects is subject to their norms.

## Code of Conduct

We follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/chaoss/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
defined by **CHAOSS**.

## License

GrimoireLab code is distributed under the GNU Public License v.3.
Contributions will be accepted under this license, except in very special
circumstances that should be defined.

## Security

The GrimoireLab maintainers take all security issues in the project seriously.
You can find all our security policies in the [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md)
document.

## Roadmap

We use a roadmap to outline the direction of GrimoireLab. In the
[ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md) document, we describe the vision and goals of
the project and what actions we'll take to achieve them.

Our actions are grouped by **themes**, which define the needs and problems
to solve for at the present time. Everything we develop for GrimoireLab
must be related to a theme. These themes will help us to determine what's
relevant for the project and what's not. It will help us say *yes* or *no*
when new features are requested or when discussions take place.

It's also important to note that the roadmap is not something written in
stone. It can change and evolve according to the needs of our community.
We'll run open discussions where we can evaluate the current status of the
project and update the roadmap.

We'll manage the roadmap and track all the activity using GitHub project
boards, issues, and pull requests.

Finally, take into account that all the information we provide in the roadmap
**IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY** and **IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE**.

## Maintainers

The maintainers of the project have permission to merge code in GrimoireLab.

New maintainers will be proposed by maintainers and accepted (granted
committer and maintainer rights) by an action vote among other maintainers
([see below](#voting-on-action-items)).

Developers can approach maintainers to ask to be proposed as a maintainer.
The main rule for acceptance of new maintainers will be their merits on the
project, including past contributions and expertise.

Maintainers may resign if they are no longer involved enough on the project.
They can also propose the removal of other maintainer's rights if they are
no longer involved on the project. After the proposal to remove someone,
there will be an action vote by maintainers, except for the one proposed
for removal.

The list of current maintainers will be updated in the [MAINTAINERS file](./MAINTAINERS.md).

## Voting on Action Items

Action items will be decided by public votes in GitHub Discussions. Anyone
can vote, to express their opinion, but the result of the vote will take into
account only the votes by general maintainers.

Votes will be cast in the following ways (details taken in part from the
Apache project):

- `+1`: Yes, agree, or the action should be performed.
- `0` : Abstain, no opinion, or I am happy to let the other group members
  decide this issue.
- `-1`: No, I veto this action. All vetoes must include an explanation of
  why the veto is appropriate. A veto with no explanation is void.

Any maintainer can propose an action vote, and it will become effective if at
least 2 other maintainers agree during a period of two days. Then maintainers
will have 4 days to cast their votes on the proposal.

Action votes will be mandatory for:

- Accepting a new maintainer.
- Proposal for removal of maintainer rights.
- Accepting a new repository in the project.
- Removing a repository from the project.
- Deciding that some certain code in some repository needs to be moved to
  some other repository.

In all the cases, the action vote will pass with at least 3 positive votes and
no vetoes.

## Contributions

The general norms for contributions are described in the
[CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CONTRIBUTING WITH CODE](./CONTRIBUTING_WITH_CODE.md)
documents.

## Incubating repositories

Sometimes, activity related to GrimoireLab may start in repositories
outside the GrimoireLab project. In those cases, if the developers collaborating
on those repositories want, they can inform GrimoireLab of their progress, and
propose coordinated actions (such as definition of APIs). However, they will be
considered external projects until the moment they are accepted as repositories
in GrimoireLab, via an action vote.
