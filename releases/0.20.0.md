  ## kidash 0.6.5 - (2024-01-30)
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies
## sortinghat 0.19.0 - (2024-01-30)

**New features:**

 * Unify identities with same source\
   Include a new option to only recommend or unify identities from
   trusted sources like GitHub or GitLab that have the same username and
   backend.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Use correct base URL for login and change password API calls (#851)\
   The URLs called to login and change password now use the public path
   found in vue.config.js if no API URL is specified.
 * Authentication required fixed\
   When the AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED setting is set to False, any query to
   the API is allowed.
 * Display individual's most recent organization\
   The individual's current affiliation is now the most recent one
   instead of the oldest.
 * CSRF token is only required on web requests\
   The GraphQL API required the 'X-CSRFToken' header, but the token could
   only be retrieved by making a GET request. Now, requests authenticated
   using JWT don't need to provide the CSRF token and only the user
   interface, which is vulnerable to CSRF attacks and uses a different
   authentication, requires it.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Performance of organizations query\
   Improve organization query for the table by avoiding individual
   queries.
