# GrimoireLab 1.0.0

For eight years, we have been working to produce the best platform for
software development analytics possible. With the work of more than
150 developers and after over 11,600 commits, we’re excited to announce
the release of the first major version of GrimoireLab.

GrimoireLab is an evolution of the work done during more than 10 years by
[Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/), LibreSoft URJC research group, and several
contributors in [Metrics Grimoire](http://metricsgrimoire.github.io/)
and [VizGrimorie](http://vizgrimoire.bitergia.org/) projects.
Since 2017, GrimoireLab has been part of The Linux Foundation
[CHAOSS Software](http://chaoss.community) community as one of its founding
projects.

GrimoireLab has become the de facto standard for open source project
health dashboards. It has been used by some of the most important
software companies and open source foundations in the world.
The platform has also been used as the underlying foundation for
other applications, including
[Bitergia Analytics](https://github.com/bitergia-analytics),
[OSS Compass](https://compass.gitee.com/),
[LFX Insights](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/insights/),
[Cauldron](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/), and
[Mystic](https://opensource.ieee.org/rit/mystic-group).

This release of GrimoireLab includes:

- An automated platform to generate software analytics and insights.
- Data collection from more than 30 data sources.
- Generation of more than 150 metrics and visualizations to understand activity,
  performance, and community of open source projects.
- Identities manager to track the activity of an individual across platforms
  and organizations.
- Integration with third-party applications to visualize and analyze data
  (Kibana/OpenSearch Dashboards/Jupiter Notebooks).

This release would not have been possible without the help of the entire
community. We are deeply thankful to all our users. We would especially
like to thank Álvaro del Castillo, Valerio Cosentino, Jesús González-Barahona,
Alberto Pérez García-Plaza, J. Manrique López, Venu Vardhan Reddy Tekula,
David Moreno, Gregorio Robles, Andy Grunwald, and the members of the
CHAOSS project.

Special recognition to [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/) and
[The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org/)
for being early adopters.

The GrimoireLab Developers.
