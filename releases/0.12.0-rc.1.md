**Performance improvements:**

 * Enrichment processing time reduced by 50%\
   The general performance was improved reducing the number of calls to
   the identities manager (i.g. `SortingHat`). There were some deprecated
   calls that weren't needed any longer and also, we increased the cache
   of individuals in ELKs. We were also able to reduce the processing
   time of the Git backend by converting commit dates only once.

  ## sirmordred 0.9.1-rc.1 - (2023-07-11)
